## Welcome to natto!

[**natto**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natt≈ç) is an extreme
**vegan** package that contains experimental, specialized or
unfinished code that does not fit to the more general **vegan**
package. Some of these functions may be merged to **vegan** later, but
the package is not a code kindergarten with guaranteed tenure track to
**vegan**.

Currently **natto** contains

 * Functions to draw projected map with given extent and automatically
   producing distribution maps with **rgbif** using proper
   cartographic projections.

 * Mean Rank Shift function of Collins et al., *Ecology* **89,**
   3534-3541 (2008).
