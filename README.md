## Welcome to natto!

**natto** is an extreme **vegan** package that contains experimental,
specialized or unfinished code that does not fit to the more general
**vegan** package. Some of these functions may be merged to **vegan**
later, but the package is not a code kindergarten with guaranteed
tenure track to **vegan**.

Currently **natto** contains

 * Functions to draw projected map with given extent and automatically
   producing distribution maps with **rgbif** using proper
   cartographic projections.

 * Mean Rank Shift function of Collins et al., *Ecology* **89,**
   3534-3541 (2008).
