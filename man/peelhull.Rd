\title{Convex Hull Enclosing a Given Proportion of Points}
\usage{
peelhull(pts, keep = 0.9, criterion = c("area", "distance", "mahalanobis"))

peelellipse(pts, keep = 0.9)
}
\arguments{
\item{pts}{Coordinates of points, a two-column matrix}

\item{keep}{Proportion of points kept}

\item{criterion}{Criterion to remove a point on the
hull. \code{"area"} removes the point that reduces the area of
the new hull as much as possible, while \code{"distance"} and
\code{"mahalanobis"} remove the point that has the largest
total distance to all points on and within the hull.}
}
\value{
A two-column matrix of coordinates of peeled hull or
    ellipse defining that can be plotted with
    \code{\link[graphics]{polygon}}, with attributes
    \code{"centre"} and \code{"area"}.
}
\description{
Functions find a small convex hull or ellipse enclosing a given
proportion of points. The functions work by removing points from
the hull or ellipse one by one. The points are selected either so
that the area of the remaining hull is reduced as much as possible
at every step (de Smith, Goodrich & Longley 2007), or removing the
point that has the maximal total distance to all remaining
points.
}
\details{
Reduction of area is the only criterion that really is based the
area of the ellipse and only uses points on the hull. The other
methods are based on the distances to all points within and on the
hull. In \code{peelpoly}, the distance can be either isometric
Euclidean distance or Mahalanobis distance where the distance is
evaluated with respect to the covariance ellipse of points in the
polygon. Function \code{peelellipse} is based on Mahalanobis
distance. The functions only work in 2D.

The algorithms are na√Øve, and stepwise removal of single points
does not guarantee smallest possible final hull. Two outlier points
close to each other can protect each other from removal, but
removing both together would give a large reduction of the
hull. The \code{"distance"} criterion produces circular hulls, but
\code{"mahalanobis"} will better preserve the original elongation
of the configuration, although it rarely gives smaller areas than
\code{"area"} criterion. \code{peelellipse} and \code{peelhull}
with criterion \code{"mahalanobis"} results have the same points on
the perimeter of the shape.

x <- matrix(c(rnorm(100), rnorm(100, sd=2)), nrow=100, ncol=2)
op <- par(mar=c(4,4,2,1), mfrow=c(2,2))
## show first ten dropped points and hull keeping 50\% of points
for (crit in c("area", "distance", "mahalanobis")) {
   plot(x, asp = 1, main = crit, xlab="", ylab="")
   for (p in c(100:90, 50)/100)
       polygon(peelhull(x, keep=p, crit=crit),
               col = adjustcolor("blue", alpha.f=0.04))
}
