\description{
Functions fit linear regression on distances within blocks and
across blocks and compere their slopes using permutation tests.
}
\details{
Functions are intended to analyse the differences of linear Mantel
regression within and across blocks. Typically the dependent
dissimilarities (\code{ydist}) are based on community data,
independent dissimilarities (\code{xdist}) are based on
environmental data, and \code{block} defines subsets of data, such
as geographical subareas.

Functions \code{slopediff} and \code{slopediff2} differ in their
permutation models. Function \code{slopediff} permutes the
classification vector defining \code{block}s, and keeps the
dependent (\code{ydist}) and independent (\code{xdist}) pairs of
dissimilarities fixed. Function \code{slopediff2} permutes
dependent data, and keeps \code{block}s and dependent distances
fixed.
