\usage{
sdca(Y, iweigh = FALSE, pairwise = FALSE, monitor = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Input data.}

\item{iweigh}{Downweight rare species.}

\item{pairwise}{Detrend axis \eqn{k} separately for each previous
axis in order \eqn{1 \dots k-1 \dots 1}. This only influences
axes 3 and 4.}

\item{monitor}{Turn on graphical monitoring of detrending for each
axis.}

\item{\dots}{Other arguments (passed to \code{\link{loess}}).}
}
\value{
Function returns a subset of \code{\link[vegan]{decorana}}
    result object and can use many \code{decorana} methods (such as
    \code{plot}).
}
\description{
Function \code{sdca} is similar to \code{\link[vegan]{decorana}},
but instead of detrending by segments it uses \code{\link{loess}}
for smooth non-linear detrending.
}
\details{
Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) as implemented in
\code{\link[vegan]{decorana}} tries to remove all systematic biases
between ordination axes by detrending later axes against previous
ones (Hill & Gauch 1980). DCA uses an ingenious method of
detrending by axis segments to allow removing non-linear
dependencies. Detrending means taking residuals against smoothed
segment means as the new ordination scores for the current axis. It
has been suggested that abrupt changes at segment borders can
cause some problems in DCA. The current function replaces segmented
detrending with detrending against smooth \code{\link{loess}}
functions. However, in many cases this changes the results little
from the original detrending by segments.

The detrending for axes 3 and 4 is perfomed either using all
previous axes simultaneously in \code{\link{loess}} (default) or if
\code{pairwise=TRUE} performing sequential separate detrending
against each previous axis separately so that both the first and
last detrending are performed against axis 1 similarly as in the
original \code{decorana}. For axis 3 the sequence is against axes
1, 2, 1 and for axis 4 against axes 1, 2, 3, 2, 1.

The \code{\link[vegan]{decorana}} software made several other
innovations than detrending. Rescaling of axes is often more
influential in application than the actual detrending, like you can
see by using \code{\link[vegan]{decorana}} without rescaling.
