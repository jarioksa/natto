\description{
Rao's quadratic entropy (Rao 1982) is a generalization of Simpson
(or Gini-Simpson) diversity index to a situation where species are
non-independent. The species dependences are expressed as
dissimilarities, where 1 means independent species, and 0 a
completely aliased species. Rao's distance (1982) is a similar
generalization for distances between sampling units with
non-independent species. Typically species distances are based on
phylogenetics, taxonomy or species traits, and these measures are
called phylogenetic or functional diversities and distances.

Function \code{raostand} modified data so that it is compatible to
other functions, and Rao's quadratic entropy and Rao distances can
be directly found from the standarized data.
}
\details{
Rao's quadratic entropy is \eqn{H_i = \sum_{j} \sum_{k}
p_{ij} p_{ik} d_{jk}}{Q[i] = sum(k) sum(j) p[ij] * p[ik] * d[jk]},
where \eqn{i} is the index of the sampling unit, \eqn{j} and
\eqn{k} are indices of species, \eqn{p} is the proportion of
species in the sampling unit, and \eqn{d} are distances among
species. The distances should be scaled to range \eqn{0...1}, and
they are divided by the observed maximum if this exceeds
1. Alternatively, the distances are divided by argument \code{dmax}
instead of data maximum. Distances that are shorter than
\code{dmax} are truncated to the maximum value. The square roots of
distances should be Euclidean, but this is not verified. They are
Euclidean if there are no negative eigenvalues in the principal
coordinates analysis, and \pkg{ade4} package has function
\code{\link[ade4]{is.euclid}} for a canned test. If all distances
are 1, species are independent and \code{qrao} will return Simpson
diversity.

Function \code{distrao} finds distances based on quadratic entropy
for sampling units. Rao (1982) suggested distance \eqn{d_{ij} =
H_{ij} - \frac{1}{2}(H_i + H_j)}{d[ij] = H[ij] - 0.5*(H[i]+H[j])},
where \eqn{H_i}{H[i]} and \eqn{H_j}{H[j]} are Rao entropies for
sites \eqn{i} and \eqn{j} and \eqn{H_{ij}}{H[ij]} is the similar
entropy evaluated so that the species proportions \eqn{p} are from
different sampling units. Rao (1982) called this as Jensen
distance, and it is half of the squared Euclidean distance. The
Euclidean distance can also be requested. In addition, Rao (1982)
suggested a standardized distance that is based on logarithms of
elements \eqn{H}.

Function \code{raostand} standardizes data similarlty as implicitly
done in \code{qrao} and \code{raodist} when \code{propx =
TRUE}. For standardized data \code{Z}, quadratic entropy is found
as \code{1 - rowSums(Z^2)}, and Rao distances can be found via
Euclidean distances of \code{Z}. The standardized data allows
calculating any generic community dissimilarity, and using \code{Z}
in \code{\link[vegan]{rda}} allows performing phylogenitically
constrained RDA. The standardization does not preserve absences,
but zero abundances will be boosted to positive values when the
sampling unit has related species.  More details can be found in
vignette.

There are other implementations of this function in
    \R. Most notably functions \code{\link[ade4]{divc}} and
    \code{\link[ade4]{disc}} in \pkg{ade4}. However, these may
    square input dissimilarities and divide results by 2 depending
    on options.  Function \code{\link{taxondist}} provides Clarke's
    taxonomic dissimilarity.
