#' Mean Rank Shift Between Pairs of Sites
#'
#' Function calculates the mean rank shift between decreasing rank
#' orders of species (columns). The averaging is done by the number of
#' species occurring in both compared sites, and the results are
#' returned as dissimilarities.
#'
#' @param x The input data.
#'
#' @param missing If \code{TRUE}, missing species (zero abundance)
#' will not be used in comparing rank shifts, but rank shifts are only
#' compared for species that occur in both compared SUs. If
#' \code{FALSE}, the missing species are given tied rank as last
#' species.
