#' Rao's Quadratic Entropy and Dissimilarity
#'
#' Rao's quadratic entropy (Rao 1982) is a generalization of Simpson
#' (or Gini-Simpson) diversity index to a situation where species are
#' non-independent. The species dependences are expressed as
#' dissimilarities, where 1 means independent species, and 0 a
#' completely aliased species. Rao's distance (1982) is a similar
#' generalization for distances between sampling units with
#' non-independent species. Typically species distances are based on
#' phylogenetics, taxonomy or species traits, and these measures are
#' called phylogenetic or functional diversities and distances.
#'
#' @details Rao's quadratic entropy is \eqn{H_i = \sum_{j} \sum_{k}
#' p_{ij} p_{ik} d_{jk}}{Q[i] = sum(k) sum(j) p[ij] * p[ik] * d[jk]},
#' where \eqn{i} is the index of the sampling unit, \eqn{j} and
#' \eqn{k} are indices of species, \eqn{p} is the proportion of
#' species in the sampling unit, and \eqn{d} are distances among
#' species. The distances should be scaled to range \eqn{0...1}, and
#' they are divided by the observed maximum if this exceeds 1. The
#' square roots of distances should be Euclidean, but this is not
#' verified. They are Euclidean if there are no negative eigenvalues
#' in the principal coordinates analysis, and \pkg{ade4} package has
#' function \code{\link[ade4]{is.euclidean}} for a canned test. If all
#' distances are 1, species are independent and \code{qrao} will
#' return Simpson diversity.
#'
#' Function \code{distrao} finds distances based on quadratic entropy
#' for sampling units. Rao (1982) suggested distance \eqn{d_{ij} =
#' H_{ij} - \frac{1}{2}(H_i + H_j)}{d[ij] = H[ij] - 0.5*(H[i]+H[j])},
#' where \eqn{H_i}{H[i]} and \eqn{H_j}{H[j]} are Rao entropies for
#' sites \eqn{i} and \eqn{j} and \eqn{H_{ij}}{H[ij]} is the similar
#' entropy evaluated so that the species proportions \eqn{p} are from
#' different sampling units. Rao (1982) called this as Jensen
#' distance, and it is half of the squared Euclidean distance. The
#' Euclidean distance can also be requested. In addition, Rao (1982)
#' suggested a standardized distance that is based on logarithms of
#' elements \eqn{H}. 
#' 
#' @param x Community data. The diversity is estimated for the rows of
#' the matrix.
#' @param d Dissimilarities among species (columns). If some some
#' dissimilarities are \eqn{>1}, these are divided with the maximum
#' dissimilarity. If all \eqn{d = 1} or \code{d} is missing,
#' \code{qrao} will return Simpson's index, and \code{qraodist} a
#' basic dissimilarity index.
#'
#' @return \code{qrao} returns a vector of Rao's quadratic entropy
#' values and \code{distrao} distances of class \code{"dist"}.

#'
#' @seealso There are other implementations of this function in
#' \R. Most notably functions \code{\link[ade4]{divc}} and
#' \code{\link{disc}} in \pkg{ade4}. However, these may square input
#' dissimilarities and divide results by 2 depending on options.
