#' Convex Hull Enclosing a Given Proportion of Points
#'
#' Functions find a small convex hull or ellipse enclosing a given
#' proportion of points. The functions work by removing points from
#' the hull or ellipse one by one. The points are selected either so
#' that the area of the remaining hull is reduced as much as possible
#' at every step (de Smith, Goodrich & Longley 2007), or removing the
#' point that has the maximal total distance to all remaining
#' points.

#' @encoding UTF-8
#'
#' @param pts Coordinates of points, a two-column matrix
#' @param keep Proportion of points kept
#' @param criterion Criterion to remove a point on the
#'     hull. \code{"area"} removes the point that reduces the area of
#'     the new hull as much as possible, while \code{"distance"} and
#'     \code{"mahalanobis"} remove the point that has the largest
#'     total distance to all points on and within the hull.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' Reduction of area is the only criterion that really is based the
#' area of the ellipse and only uses points on the hull. The other
#' methods are based on the distances to all points within and on the
#' hull. In \code{peelpoly}, the distance can be either isometric
#' Euclidean distance or Mahalanobis distance where the distance is
#' evaluated with respect to the covariance ellipse of points in the
#' polygon. Function \code{peelellipse} is based on Mahalanobis
#' distance. The functions only work in 2D.
#'
#' The algorithms are na√Øve, and stepwise removal of single points
#' does not guarantee smallest possible final hull. Two outlier points
#' close to each other can protect each other from removal, but
#' removing both together would give a large reduction of the
#' hull. The \code{"distance"} criterion produces circular hulls, but
#' \code{"mahalanobis"} will better preserve the original elongation
#' of the configuration, although it rarely gives smaller areas than
#' \code{"area"} criterion. \code{peelellipse} and \code{peelhull}
#' with criterion \code{"mahalanobis"} results have the same points on
#' the perimeter of the shape.

### To evaluate the algorithms, use the following (input matrix x1):
### sapply(c("area","dist","maha"), function(a) {plot(x1, asp=1);for(p
### in c(100:90, 61, 50)/100) polygon(peelhull(x1, keep=p, crit=a),
### col=adjustcolor("blue", alpha.f=0.05));attr(peelhull(x1, 0.61, a),
### "area")})

### Similar to peelhull but for ellipses: remove point with largest
### Mahalanobis distance, update and remove next point, and finally
### return the enclosing ellipse
