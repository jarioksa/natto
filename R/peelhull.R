#' Convex Hull Enclosing a Given Proportion of Points
#'
#' Function finds a small convex hull enclosing a given proportion of
#' points. The function works by removing points from the hull one by
#' one. The points are selected either so that the area of the
#' remaining hull is reduced as much as possible at every step (de
#' Smith, Goodrich & Longley 2007), or removing the point that has the
#' maximal total distance to all remaining points. The function only
#' works in 2D.

#'
#' @param pts Coordinates of points, a two-column matrix
#' @param keep Proportion of points kept
#' @param criterion Criterion to remove a point on the
#'     hull. \code{"area"} removes the point that reduces the area of
#'     the new hull as much as possible, and \code{"distance"} removes
#'     the point that has the largest total distance to all points on
#'     and within the hull.
#'
#' @details This is preliminary work (but without guarantee of
#'     progress). However, the current function is such that it can be
#'     easily plugged into \code{\link[vegan]{ordihull}}
#'     (\CRANpkg{vegan} package).
#'
#' The algorithms are na√Øve, and stepwise removal of single points
#' does not guarantee smallest possible final hull. Although the area
#' reduction algorithm was found in literature (de Smith et al. 2007),
#' the distance criterion often gives smaller final convex hulls.

### Similar to peelhull but for ellipses: remove point with largest
### Mahalanobis distance, update and remove next point, and finally
### return the enclosing ellipse
