#' Residual Species Associations in Constrained Ordination
#'
#' Function finds residual species association after fitting the
#' constraints (and conditions) in constrained ordination
#' (\code{\link[vegan]{cca}}, \code{\link[vegan]{rda}}).
#'
#' @details
#'
#' The residual unconstrained axes can be used to assess if there is
#' any important unexplained variation in constrained ordination. This
#' approach was proposed already in the first papers on constrained
#' ordination (ter Braak 1986). However, this has been rarely done,
#' mainly because there are no easily available tools to assess the
#' unconstrained axes. Bayesian analysis of species communities
#' (Tikhonov et al. 2020) is conceptually similar to constrained
#' ordination. There the random effects are analysed \emph{via}
#' correlated species responses that are interpreted to be caused by
#' unknown environmental variables or residual inter-species
#' association. The random effects are found as Bayesian latent
#' factors which are conceptually similar to residual axes in
#' constrained ordination (although these are maximum likelihood
#' principal components). It is customary represent these residual
#' correlations as ordered correlation matrix (Tikhonov et al
#' 2017). This function provides similar tools for constrained
#' correpsondence analysis (CCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA) as
#' perfomed in \CRANpkg{vegan} functions \code{\link[vegan]{cca}} and
#' \code{\link[vegan]{rda}}.
#'
#' In Bayesian framework, we only try to extract a low number of
#' latent factors needed to describe correlated random variation. In
#' constrained ordination, all residual variation is accounted for by
#' residual axes. For meaningful analysis, we should only look at some
#' first axes which may reflect systematic unexplained variation. With
#' all axes, the residual correlations are usually nearly zero and
#' systematic variation is masked by non-systematic noise. Therefore
#' we should only have a look at some first axes. Users can either
#' specify the number of axes used, and the default is to use
#' brokenstick distribution (\CRANpkg{vegan} function
#' (\code{\link[vegan]{bstick}}) to assess the number of axes that
#' have surprisingly high eigenvalues and may reflect unaccounted
#' systematic variation. The function returns inter-species
#' associations as correlation-like numbers, where values nearly zero
#' mean non-associated species. These values can be plotted in
#' correlation plot or analysed directly. The correlations are
#' directly found from the residual ordination axes.
#'
#' It is an attractive idea to interpret inter-species association to
#' describe ecological interactions among species (Tikhonov et
#' el. 2017). This indeed is possible, but there are other alternative
#' explanations, such as missing environmental variables or modelling
#' errors (model formula, scaling of species, scaling of environmental
#' variables, assumptions on the shape of species response etc.). You
#' should be cautious in interpreting the results (and the same
#' applies also to the analogous Bayesian model).
