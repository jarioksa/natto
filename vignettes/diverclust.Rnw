\section{Introduction}

The \pkg{natto} package includes function \code{diverclust} that
introduces a potentially new method of beta and gamma diversity
clustering.  The idea of this new method is obvious and I have long
assumed that such a method must have been invented previously.
However, I have failed to find such a method, and therefore I added
the function in \pkg{natto}.  This document describes the method as
implemented in \pkg{natto} for two purposes: to explain what was done
in \pkg{natto} and to help finding its predecessors.

\section{The Method}

\subsection{The Stages of Clustering}

The main steps are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Initially estimate diversity of all sampling units
  (\S~\ref{sec:diversity}).
\item First evaluate the \emph{increase} in diversity when you
  pool together two sampling units (optionally with equalization,
  \S~\ref{sec:equalize}). The increase in diversity in pooling is
  conventionally called as beta diversity.
\item Select the smallest of pooled values and make it a cluster.
\item Pool the sampling units of the new merged cluster by summing up
  abundance values (optionally with equalization
  \S~\ref{sec:equalize}), and re-evaluate its beta diversities with
  all other sites.
\item Go back to step 3 until all sampling units are merged.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Measurement of Diversity}
\label{sec:diversity}

Diversity indices are based on proportional abundances $p_j$ of for
species $j = 1 \ldots S$, where $S$ is the number of species. The
species proportions are normally found from community matrix
$\{x_{ij}\}$ by dividing by the sum of row sums
$p_j = x_{ij}/\sum_{i=1}^N x_{ij}$.  The \code{diverclust} function
uses \pkg{vegan} function \code{renyi} to evaluate any Rényi diversity
or the corresponding Hill number.  R{\'e}nyi diversity of order $a$ is
\cite{Hill73number}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:renyi}
H_a = \frac{1}{1-a} \log \sum_{j=1}^S p_j^a \,,
\end{equation}
and the corresponding Hill number is $N_a = \exp(H_a)$.  Many common
diversity indices are special cases of Hill numbers: $N_0 = S$,
$N_1 = \exp(H')$, $N_2 = 1/\sum_{j=1}^S p_j^2$, and $N_\infty = 1/(\max p_j)$. The
corresponding R\'{e}nyi diversities are $H_0 = \log(S)$, $H_1 = H'$,
$H_2 = - \log(\sum p_j^2)$, and $H_\infty = -\log(\max p_j)$.

The beta diversity is defined as an increase of diversity when pooling
sampling units. Pooling happens by summing up abundance values of
species, and the beta diversity $\beta$ for a cluster of $M$ sampling
units is defined as a difference of gamma and mean alpha diversities
$\beta = \gamma - \bar \alpha$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:partition}
  \beta_a = \underbrace{H_a \left(\sum_{i=1}^M x_{ij}
    \right)}_{\gamma} - \underbrace{\frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^M H_a
    (x_{ij})}_{\bar \alpha}\,,
\end{equation}
where $x$ are the community data. Alternatively we can use Hill
numbers $N_a$ in place of $H_a$. The first includes both the
within-unit diversity and the between-unit differences and represents
the overall diversity also known as the gamma diversity, and the
second term is the averaged within-site diversity, and the equation is
of the form $\beta = \gamma -\bar \alpha$ which seems to imply
additive partitioning of diversity. However, Rényi diversities are on
$\log$ scale which translates a multiplicative model into an additive
model. If you use Hill numbers in eq.~\ref{eq:partition}, the model is
truly additive.

\subsection{Equalizing Observations}
\label{sec:equalize}

The total pooled diversity ($\gamma$) in eq.~\ref{eq:partition}
includes both the within-unit diversity ($\alpha$) and between-unit
differences ($\beta$). This requires that pooled diversity really is
additive: it maintains the within-unit diversity and adds between-unit
differences. This really seem to be the case with Rényi diversities,
but not necessarily for the Hill numbers beyond $N_0 = S$ (species
richness). However, if equalize the sampling units, the
additivity is greatly improved. Equalization scales units with
different total abundances to a more similar magnitude for pooling,
but does not influence their alpha diversities. The suggested
equalization is dependent on the scale $a$ of the Rényi diversity, and
all values for a unit are divided by weight
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:equalize}
  w_i = \left( \sum_{j=1}^S x_{ij}^a \right)^{1/a}\,.
\end{equation}
For $a=1$ (Shannon diversity) $w$ scales to unit sum, for $a=2$
(Simpson diversity) $w$ scales to unit sum of squares (norm), and for
$a=\infty$ (Berger-Parker diversity) $w$ is the maximum for each
sampling unit. No equalization is needed for $a=0$ (species
richness). 

\subsection{Clustering Based on gamma Diversity}

If we omit the $\bar \alpha$ term for average alpha diversity in
eq.~\ref{eq:partition}, we can base the clustering on total or gamma
diversity. It may be difficult to see what would be the utility of such a
clustering, but perhaps it could be used to form low-diversity classes
that differ from each other. 

\subsection{Implementation}

Function \code{diverclust} implements beta and gamma diversity
clustering as described above. The following options can be used to
modify its behaviour:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The scale $a$ of Rényi diversity (eq.~\ref{eq:renyi}) can be given.
  \item The equalization of eq.~ref{eq:equalize} can be turned off or on.
  \item beta or gamma diversity clustering can be selected.
  \item Either Rényi diversities or Hill numbers can be selected.
\end{itemize}

\section{Other Methods}

One reason for writing this vignette was to find out if the
\code{diverclust} function re-invents an existing method. Information
Analysis \cite{WilliamsEa66, LanceWilliams66} that is implemented as
function \code{infodist} in the \pkg{natto} package.

\subsection{Clustering Based on Information Analysis}

Information analysis can only analyse binary community data
matrix. The information content $I$ of a cluster of $M$ sampling units
is defined as \cite{WilliamsEa66, LanceWilliams66}:
\begin{multline}
  \label{eq:information}
  I = S M \log M \\ - \sum_{j=1}^S Mp_j \log Mp_j + M(1-p_j) \log M(1-p_j)\,,
\end{multline} 
where $p_j$ is the relative frequency of species $j$ in the
cluster. The contribution to $I$ is 0 for species absent from the
cluster ($p=0$) and for species present on every unit in the cluster
($p=1$), and it is maximal for species with frequency $p=0.5$. The
clustering minimizes the information criterion $I$ and therefore it
tries to produce clusters where species are either absent or nearly
absent, or constant or nearly so. This often produces clusters that
are easy to interpret in floristic terms.

The clustering is produced similarly is in \code{diverclust}: two
sampling units or clusters are pooled, the species frequencies are
recalculated, and the information content with the pooled group and
all other groups are re-evaluated. The most important difference is
that the groups selected for merging is not not the one with lowest
$I$, but the group that gives the lowest increase $\Delta I$. The
merge still happens at the level of pooled new unit $I$, and the
clusters are not formed in the order of their merge heights. This
conflicts with \R{} conventions, and the \code{infoclust} function
updates the merge table to correspond to the merge heights. 

\citet{WilliamsEa66} and \citet{LanceWilliams66} describe their method
very briefly, and the current implementation is \pkg{natto} is based
on the worked out example of \citet{Legendres}. 

\subsection{Dissimilarity Measures}

The diversity clustering methods can also be expressed as
dissimilarity measures for two pooled sampling units. Such
dissimilarity measures do not produce the diversity clustering,
because the indices cannot be directly updated two dissimilarities
between clusters, but they must be updated with the original
data. However, it may be instructive to compare these indices with
common dissimilarity measures. In this chapter we see how the
diversity measures can be expressed as dissimilarities with binary
data. 

This defines a community with maximum equitability, so that all Rényi
indices will be $N = \log S$ and Hill numbers $H = S$ irrespective of
the Rényi scale.  Average alpha diversity for two sampling units with
$S_1$ and $S_2$ species is
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:alphaH}
  \bar \alpha_H &= \tfrac{1}{2}(\log S_1 + \log S_2)\\
  \bar \alpha_N &= \tfrac{1}{2}(S_1 + S_2)\,.
\end{align}
In two sampling units of $S_1$ and $S_2$ species and $J$ shared
species, there will be $S_1 + S_2 - 2J$ species that occur only one of
the units and with proportion $p = \frac{1}{S_1 + S_2}$ and $J$
species that occur in both sampling units with
$p = \frac{2}{S_1 + S_2}$.  The general form partition of
eq.~\ref{eq:partition} of distances between two binary observations
with Rényi diversity (eq.~\ref{eq:renyi}) is
\begin{multline}
  d(H_a) = \frac{1}{1-a} [\log(S_1+S_2 + (2^a - 2) J) \\- a \log (S_1+S_2)] - \bar \alpha_H
\end{multline}
Some special cases simplify into more compact forms:
\begin{align}
  d(H_0) &= \log(S_1 + S_2 -J) - \bar \alpha_H\\ 
         &= \log \left(\frac{A+B-J}{\sqrt{S_1 S_2}} \right) \\ 
  d(N_0) &= \tfrac{1}{2}(S_1 + S_2 - 2J)\\
           &= \bar \alpha_N - J \\
  \label{eq:dH1}
  d(H_1) &= \log(S_1 + S_2) - \frac{J \log 4}{S_1+S_2} - \bar \alpha_H\\
  d(H_2) &= 2 \log (S_1+S_2) - \log(S_1 + S_2 + 2J) - \bar \alpha_H\\
  d(N_2) &= \frac{(S_1 + S_2)^2}{S_1 + S_2 + 2J}  - \bar \alpha_N\\
  d(H_\infty) &= \log(S_1 + S_2) - \log 2 - \bar \alpha_H\\
  d(N_\infty) &= 0 \,.
\end{align}
These may be regarded as ``new'' dissimilarity measures, although
there hardly is a deficit of dissimilarity indices. However, $d(N_0)$
is only half of the number of non-shared species, or half of the
squared Euclidean distance between binary vectors. Most importantly,
these are special cases for binary data and two pooled sampling
units. Although the indices can be calculated for binary data, they
really are intended for quantitative data. More importantly, they are
intended for comparisons among multiple sampling units, and this can
only be done via pooling original sampling units.

The implicit dissimilarity measure in information analysis is
\begin{equation}
  d(I) = (S_1 + S_2 - 2J) \log(4) \,.
\end{equation}
This is $d(N_0)$ scaled. However, the similarity disappears when more
than two sampling units are compared.

Dissimilarities based on diversity or information have been sometimes
suggested. \citet{KoleffEa03} suggest the following that they ascribe
to \citet{Routledge84}:
\begin{multline}
  \label{eq:routledge}
  d(I) = \log(S_1 + S_2) - \frac{J \log 4}{S_1 + S_2} \\ 
  - \frac{S_1}{S_1 + S_2} \log S_1 - \frac{S_2}{S_1+S_2} \log S_2\,.
\end{multline}
This resembles a lot our $d(H_1)$. The only difference is that
$d(H_1)$ (eq.~\ref{eq:dH1}) uses unweighted average alpha diversity
$\bar \alpha_H$ (eq.~\ref{eq:alphaH}), whereas eq.~\ref{eq:routledge}
weights sampling units by their species richness values.
